//The aim of this programming assignment is to write a program that given a non-deterministic finite automaton N and a word w,
//determines if w âˆˆ L(N). The non-deterministic finite state machine may be an example from the textbook.
//The simulation will also specify all the transitions starting from the initial state and arriving to the accept state.
